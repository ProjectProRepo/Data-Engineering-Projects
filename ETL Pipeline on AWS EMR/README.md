# Build an ETL Pipeline on EMR using AWS CDK and Power BI  

## Overview  

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is transforming how cloud resources are provisioned and managed. Instead of manual setup, **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)** allows defining cloud infrastructure using **Python, Java, TypeScript, and .NET**. In this project, we will build an **ETL Pipeline on Amazon EMR** using **AWS CDK and Apache Hive**, leveraging **AWS S3 for data storage** and **Power BI for dynamic visualizations**.  

The project demonstrates how **Apache Hive on Amazon EMR** enables efficient data transformation and analysis, while **Power BI** creates **interactive dashboards** for business insights.  

## Project Objectives  

- Learn the fundamentals of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CDK**.  
- Understand **Amazon EMR and Apache Hive** for **big data processing**.  
- Deploy an **ETL pipeline** using **AWS services** such as **S3, Cloud9, EMR, and CDK**.  
- Work with **sales data**, performing transformations using **Hive scripts**.  
- Connect **Power BI** to **Hive tables** for **data visualization**.  
- Learn to deploy **secure and scalable cloud infrastructure** using AWS CDK.  

## Prerequisites  

Before starting this project, ensure you have:  

- Basic understanding of **AWS cloud services (S3, EMR, IAM, CDK)**.  
- Knowledge of **Python and SQL** for scripting and querying.  
- Experience with **Power BI** for building interactive dashboards.  
- An **AWS account** with access to **S3, EMR, and IAM policies**.  
- A working knowledge of **Hive and big data processing**.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Language**: Python  
- **AWS Services**: S3, Cloud9, AWS CDK, Amazon EMR, Power BI, Apache Hive  

## Expected Outcomes  

By completing this project, you will:  

- Deploy **AWS resources** using **AWS CDK** for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.  
- Understand how **Apache Hive on EMR** processes and transforms big data.  
- Automate the **ETL pipeline deployment** using **AWS CDK**.  
- Connect **Power BI to EMR** for **data visualization**.  
- Debug and maintain **AWS CDK stacks** efficiently.  

## Key Features of the ETL Pipeline  

- **Serverless Infrastructure**: Uses **AWS CDK for automated deployment**.  
- **Scalable ETL Processing**: Processes large datasets using **Apache Hive on EMR**.  
- **Secure Data Storage**: Uses **Amazon S3 with IAM role-based access control**.  
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Connects **Power BI** to **Hive tables for real-time analytics**.  
- **Automated Debugging & Deployment**: Enables **CI/CD workflows using AWS CDK**.  

## Important Notes  

- **AWS Cloud9 Deprecation**: New users should use **Visual Studio Code** instead of Cloud9.  
- **AWS Costs**: Running an **EMR cluster** may incur **AWS charges**. Monitor usage.  
- **Power BI Licensing**: Ensure **Power BI Pro or Premium** is available for cloud-based connections.

## Next Steps  

- Extend the project to **support streaming data** instead of batch processing.  
- Integrate **AWS Glue** for enhanced ETL capabilities.  
- Implement **machine learning models** for sales forecasting.  
- Automate **EMR scaling** based on workload demand.
