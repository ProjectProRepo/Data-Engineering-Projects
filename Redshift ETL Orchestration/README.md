# Orchestrate Redshift ETL using AWS Glue and Step Functions

## Overview
Efficient ETL orchestration is crucial for data-driven organizations aiming to consolidate and analyze large datasets. In this project, you will use AWS Glue and AWS Step Functions to orchestrate an automated ETL pipeline, enabling seamless extraction, transformation, and loading of data into an Amazon Redshift cluster for faster analytical insights.

## Project Objectives
- Understand the business use case behind Redshift ETL orchestration.
- Visualize and implement the complete AWS-based ETL architecture.
- Configure key AWS services like Glue, Step Functions, Redshift, VPC, and SNS.
- Build a scalable and resilient ETL pipeline that automatically handles failures and notifications.
- Create an interactive analytics dashboard with Amazon QuickSight.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of AWS services (IAM, S3, Redshift, Step Functions, Glue).
- Familiarity with Python and SQL.
- AWS account with permissions to create VPCs, Redshift clusters, and Glue jobs.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python 3, SQL
- **Services**: AWS Glue, AWS Step Functions, Amazon Redshift, Amazon SNS, VPC, Amazon QuickSight
- **Libraries**: boto3, sys

## Expected Outcomes
- Build a fully operational ETL workflow using AWS-native tools.
- Automate data extraction, transformation, loading, and notifications.
- Visualize processed data using QuickSight dashboards.

# Key Features of the Project
- **Serverless ETL** with AWS Glue.
- **Workflow Orchestration** using AWS Step Functions.
- **Data Warehousing** with Amazon Redshift.
- **Error Handling** and **Alerting** with Amazon SNS.
- **Secure Networking** with AWS VPC.
- **Business Intelligence** reporting with Amazon QuickSight.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that all services are deployed in the same AWS Region.
- Follow AWS best practices for IAM role permissions.
- Redshift clusters should be provisioned within private subnets for security.
