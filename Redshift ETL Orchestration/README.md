# Orchestrate Redshift ETL using AWS Glue and Step Functions

## Overview
Efficient ETL orchestration is crucial for data-driven organizations aiming to consolidate and analyze large datasets. In this project, you will use AWS Glue and AWS Step Functions to orchestrate an automated ETL pipeline, enabling seamless extraction, transformation, and loading of data into an Amazon Redshift cluster for faster analytical insights.

## Project Objectives
- Understand the business use case behind Redshift ETL orchestration.
- Visualize and implement the complete AWS-based ETL architecture.
- Configure key AWS services like Glue, Step Functions, Redshift, VPC, and SNS.
- Build a scalable and resilient ETL pipeline that automatically handles failures and notifications.
- Create an interactive analytics dashboard with Amazon QuickSight.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of AWS services (IAM, S3, Redshift, Step Functions, Glue).
- Familiarity with Python and SQL.
- AWS account with permissions to create VPCs, Redshift clusters, and Glue jobs.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python 3, SQL
- **Services**: AWS Glue, AWS Step Functions, Amazon Redshift, Amazon SNS, VPC, Amazon QuickSight
- **Libraries**: boto3, sys

## Expected Outcomes
- Build a fully operational ETL workflow using AWS-native tools.
- Automate data extraction, transformation, loading, and notifications.
- Visualize processed data using QuickSight dashboards.

## Key Features
- **Serverless ETL** with AWS Glue.
- **Workflow Orchestration** using AWS Step Functions.
- **Data Warehousing** with Amazon Redshift.
- **Error Handling** and **Alerting** with Amazon SNS.
- **Secure Networking** with AWS VPC.
- **Business Intelligence** reporting with Amazon QuickSight.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that all services are deployed in the same AWS Region.
- Follow AWS best practices for IAM role permissions.
- Redshift clusters should be provisioned within private subnets for security.

# Project Description

## Business Overview
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes are essential for integrating data from various sources into a unified storage system like a data warehouse. Historically fundamental to the growth of databases and analytics, ETL today plays a pivotal role in enabling Machine Learning and Business Intelligence operations.

In this project, you will orchestrate a full ETL workflow using AWS Glue and Step Functions to load and transform Amazon Customer Reviews data into Amazon Redshift. This solution leverages AWS-native services, ensuring high availability, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

# Solution Approach

### 1. Setting up a VPC
- Create a new VPC named `myprojectvpc`.
- Create two public and two private subnets.
- Configure route tables, NAT Gateways, and Security Groups.

### 2. Creating a Redshift Cluster
- Launch a Redshift cluster within the private subnet.
- Use Redshift Spectrum to query external S3 data and load into Redshift tables.

### 3. Creating S3 Buckets
- Create S3 buckets using AWS CLI to store ETL scripts and SQL files.
- Example CLI command:  
  ```bash
  aws s3 mb s3://redshift-scriptbucket261191
  ```

### 4. Creating and Executing Glue Jobs
- Create Glue connections for Redshift.
- Write Glue Python Shell jobs to extract and load data.
- Create IAM roles and policies for Glue jobs.

### 5. Setting up Amazon SNS
- Create an SNS topic for failure notifications.
- Set up an email subscription and verify email addresses.

### 6. Implementing Step Functions
- Create a Step Function state machine.
- Define tasks for Glue job executions and error handling.
- Integrate SNS notification in case of job failures.

### 7. Visualizing Data with QuickSight
- Connect Amazon QuickSight to Redshift.
- Build interactive dashboards based on the loaded customer review data.

# Dataset Overview

The project uses the **Amazon Customer Reviews** dataset:
- Sourced from Amazon S3.
- Parquet format partitioned by product category.
- Data includes customer feedback, useful for sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, and more.

---

# Use Cases

- **Data Ingestion and Transformation**: Automate extraction, transformation, and storage of large datasets.
- **Complex Data Transformations**: Perform multi-stage transformations and aggregations.
- **Scheduled ETL Pipelines**: Set up periodic data updates for reporting or machine learning.
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Process streaming data into Redshift for near real-time analytics.
- **Error Handling and Recovery**: Ensure resilience through retries and SNS alerts.

---

# Learning Takeaways

- Set up secure AWS networking (VPC, Subnets, NAT).
- Create and manage Redshift clusters and connections.
- Develop Glue jobs for ETL tasks with Redshift.
- Build and visualize workflows with AWS Step Functions.
- Set up notification mechanisms using Amazon SNS.
- Design analytics dashboards using Amazon QuickSight.
