# SQL Project for Data Analysis using Oracle Database - Part 5  
In this SQL project, you'll perform advanced data analysis using Oracle SQL Developer and explore analytical SQL functions such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, SUBSTR, INSTR, COALESCE, and NVL. The project aims to deepen your understanding of how to handle ranking, string manipulation, null values, and formatting while querying structured datasets.

---

## Project Objectives  
- Understand the structure and aim of the project  
- Learn to use Oracle SQL Developer for data analysis  
- Understand and apply analytical functions like ROW_NUMBER  
- Use RANK and DENSE_RANK for comparative data ranking  
- Understand the difference between RANK and DENSE_RANK  
- Perform string manipulation using SUBSTR and INSTR  
- Deal with missing data using NVL and COALESCE  
- Format and transform dates using SQL date functions  
- Apply built-in functions like CONCAT, UPPER, LOWER, INITCAP, RTRIM, LTRIM, LENGTH, LPAD, and RPAD  

---

## Prerequisites  
- Oracle SQL Developer installed and configured  
- Basic understanding of SQL queries and relational databases  
- Familiarity with SELECT statements and data filtering  
- Prior knowledge of aggregate and conditional SQL functions is helpful  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Language**: SQL  
- **Tool**: Oracle SQL Developer  

---

## Expected Outcomes  
- Perform complex data analysis using Oracle SQL functions  
- Apply ranking logic using ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK  
- Extract and manipulate string data using SUBSTR and INSTR  
- Handle NULL values gracefully using NVL and COALESCE  
- Format and clean textual and date data using built-in functions  
- Understand how to prepare and standardize data for reporting  

---

## Key Features  
- Learn advanced SQL functions to rank and segment datasets  
- Use SUBSTR and INSTR to parse and analyze string columns  
- Implement NULL-handling strategies with COALESCE and NVL  
- Practice with built-in functions to clean and format textual data  
- Change and format date values to suit reporting needs  
- Use Oracle SQL Developer's worksheet for structured query execution  

---

## Important Notes  
- Ensure Oracle SQL Developer is properly configured with a sample database before executing queries  
- Take backups of your working tables to avoid accidental data loss  
- Use aliases and column formatting for better readability in query outputs  
- Practice querying subsets of data before applying functions to the full dataset

## Dataset Overview  
This project uses structured relational tables such as employee records, customer orders, and product details (based on sample HR or sales databases). These tables contain a mix of numeric, string, and date columnsâ€”ideal for demonstrating the SQL functions listed above.

## Next Steps  
- Explore use of other analytic functions like NTILE and PERCENT_RANK  
- Combine string and numeric functions for complex transformation logic  
- Apply these techniques to build real-world reports or dashboards  
- Automate queries using PL/SQL procedures or stored scripts  
- Integrate results with visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau
