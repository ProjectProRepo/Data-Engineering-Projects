# SQL Project for Data Analysis Using Oracle Database – Part 1

## Overview

In this project, you will learn how to perform foundational and advanced **data analysis using SQL** on the **Oracle Database 21c** platform. This project simulates real-world data analysis tasks such as filtering, ordering, transforming, and understanding complex relationships between employee and department records. It’s ideal for anyone looking to strengthen their SQL skills using one of the industry-standard RDBMS platforms.

You’ll use tools like **Oracle SQL Developer** and **SQL*Plus** to create and manipulate tables, run analytical queries, and explore data patterns in a hands-on, structured environment.

## Project Objectives

- Understand how to **install and set up Oracle Database 21c**.  
- Connect to the database using **Oracle SQL Developer** and **SQL*Plus**.  
- Learn **DML commands** to insert, update, and manipulate employee data.  
- Work with **NULL values**, **pattern matching**, and **ordering results**.  
- Explore **complex nested query conditions** for real-world scenarios.  
- Practice **table creation**, **data insertion**, and **backup** operations.  
- Understand the **usage of COMMIT and ROLLBACK** in transactional control.  
- Rename columns and fetch **distinct** results for better insights.  
- Analyze relationships between **employees and departments**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

- A system compatible with **Oracle Database 21c** (Windows or use provided labs for macOS).  
- Installed **Oracle SQL Developer** and configured it for database connection.  
- Familiarity with basic **SQL syntax** and **relational database concepts**.  
- Some understanding of **data manipulation**, **querying**, and **schema design**.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: SQL  
- **Database**: Oracle Database 21c  
- **Tools**: Oracle SQL Developer, SQL*Plus  
- **Data**: Employee and Department Tables (Sample HR Schema Style)

## Expected Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain hands-on experience with **Oracle SQL commands** for data analysis.  
- Understand how to use **analytical SQL features** to answer business questions.  
- Learn how to manage **transactions** and ensure **data consistency**.  
- Build confidence in handling **real-world datasets** with multiple relationships.  
- Prepare yourself for **interviews or job roles** requiring Oracle SQL experience.

## Key Features of the Project

- **Structured Query Practice**: Learn through practical querying tasks.  
- **Nested Conditions**: Solve problems using layered WHERE conditions.  
- **Transaction Control**: Use COMMIT, ROLLBACK to manage data integrity.  
- **Pattern-Based Queries**: Use LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, and other operators.  
- **Data Handling**: Manage NULLs, DISTINCT records, and renaming columns.  
- **Tool Usage**: Use SQL Developer and SQL*Plus to interact with Oracle DB.  

## Important Notes

- **macOS Users**: Oracle Database is not supported on macOS. Use provided labs or a virtual machine.  
- **Password Setup**: During Oracle installation, ensure you set a password for the SYSTEM user.  
- **User Permissions**: Always connect with correct privileges (SYSTEM or a configured schema).  
- **Database Backup**: Practice backing up tables before performing critical operations.  

## Dataset Overview

The project uses sample employee and department data similar to the HR schema. Attributes include:

- `employee_id`  
- `employee_name`  
- `department_id`  
- `salary`  
- `hire_date`  
- `job_title`  
- `manager_id`  
- `location`  

You’ll create these tables, populate them manually, and perform various analysis tasks using SQL.

## Next Steps

- Extend the project with **JOIN operations** and **aggregation queries**.  
- Implement **views, indexes, and stored procedures** for optimized querying.  
- Move toward **PL/SQL** to handle logic beyond basic SQL.  
- Migrate the schema to **cloud-based Oracle environments** (e.g., Oracle Cloud Free Tier).
