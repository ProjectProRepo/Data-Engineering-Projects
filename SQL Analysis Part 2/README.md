# SQL Project for Data Analysis using Oracle Database – Part 2

## Overview

This is the second part of the SQL project series focused on mastering **data analysis techniques using SQL in Oracle Database**. In this hands-on project, you'll delve deeper into SQL operations by learning how to efficiently join multiple tables, work with various operators, and troubleshoot common SQL errors using **Oracle SQL Developer**.

The project builds on foundational SQL skills and introduces complex queries, **ANSI-style joins**, and essential set operations like **UNION**, **UNION ALL**, **INTERSECT**, and **MINUS**. By the end of this project, you’ll be equipped to handle real-world dataset analysis tasks using Oracle SQL with clarity and confidence.

## Project Objectives

- Understand and navigate **Oracle SQL Developer**.
- Grasp core data analysis concepts using SQL.
- Master various **SQL join types**:
  - Inner Join
  - Left Outer Join
  - Right Outer Join
  - Full Outer Join
  - Self Join
- Learn and implement **SQL set operators**:
  - UNION vs UNION ALL
  - MINUS
  - INTERSECT
- Understand and resolve the **column ambiguously defined** error.
- Differentiate between standard (Oracle-style) queries and **ANSI SQL syntax**.
- Join multiple tables using both native and ANSI syntax.
- Enhance your analytical SQL capabilities with advanced query techniques.

---

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Part 1: Oracle installation and SQL basics.
- Installed and configured **Oracle SQL Developer** (Windows/Linux users).
- For macOS users: Use cloud-hosted Oracle Labs as Oracle DB is not natively supported on macOS.

---

## Tech Stack

**Language**: SQL  
**Environment**: Oracle SQL Developer  
**Platform**: Oracle Database (local or cloud labs)

---

## Expected Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain hands-on experience analyzing structured data in Oracle Database.
- Understand different SQL join strategies and apply them effectively.
- Confidently write multi-table join queries using **ANSI syntax**.
- Use set operations like **UNION, MINUS, INTERSECT** for advanced data comparisons.
- Handle and resolve SQL errors like **column ambiguously defined**.
- Write optimized and readable SQL queries for real-world use cases.

---

## Key Features of the Project

- **Real-World Querying**: Apply joins and operators on practical data sets.
- **Tool-Focused Learning**: Full usage of Oracle SQL Developer IDE, including worksheets and execution plans.
- **Error Debugging**: Learn to troubleshoot SQL syntax and ambiguity errors efficiently.
- **Structured Progression**: Builds on SQL basics from Part 1 and prepares for more advanced SQL analytics projects.
- **Best Practices**: Develop clean, scalable SQL code using ANSI standards.

## Dataset Analysis

**What is Dataset Analysis?**  
Dataset analysis is the process of transforming raw or unstructured data into meaningful insights that support business decision-making. It involves:

- **Organizing the dataset**
- **Cleaning and transforming data**
- **Visualizing key trends**
- **Modeling data for future predictions**

In this project, SQL plays a crucial role in querying, organizing, and aggregating the dataset to derive actionable insights.

---

## Oracle SQL Developer

**Oracle SQL Developer** is a free, integrated development environment (IDE) designed for working with Oracle databases. It allows you to:

- Write and run SQL queries and PL/SQL procedures.
- Explore database objects visually.
- Perform database administration tasks.
- Generate reports and export data.
- Work in both traditional on-premises and cloud-based Oracle environments.

This project will use Oracle SQL Developer extensively for all query execution and data analysis.

---

## Topics Covered

- Oracle SQL Developer setup and interface
- Dataset exploration and table structures
- SQL basics refresher (if needed)
- SQL Joins:
  - Inner Join
  - Left Outer Join
  - Right Outer Join
  - Full Outer Join
  - Self Join
- SQL Operators:
  - UNION
  - UNION ALL
  - MINUS
  - INTERSECT
- ANSI SQL vs Oracle-style joins
- Column ambiguity and how to fix it
- Writing multi-table joins with and without aliases

---

## Special Notes

- **macOS Users**: Oracle DB is not directly supported. Use the provided online labs.
- Be sure to **alias** table columns properly when working with multi-table joins to avoid ambiguous column errors.
- Follow ANSI standards for clean, readable code—especially useful when collaborating across teams.

---

## Next Steps

After completing this project, you can:

- Move to Part 3: Advanced data analysis using **Window Functions**, **Subqueries**, and **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**.
- Integrate SQL analysis with reporting tools like **Power BI** or **Tableau**.
- Explore **PL/SQL** for procedural programming and data manipulation automation.
- Connect Oracle SQL with Python for data pipeline automation.
