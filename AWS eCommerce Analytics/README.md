# Build an Analytical Platform for eCommerce using AWS Services  
In this AWS Big Data project, you will simulate an eCommerce platform’s user behavior—product views, cart activity, purchases—and build both batch and real-time analytics pipelines. You’ll leverage AWS services like Glue, Athena, Kinesis, Lambda, QuickSight, and DynamoDB to gain business insights, detect anomalies, and build a resilient, scalable analytical architecture.

---

## Project Objectives  
- Understand the high-level architecture of a cloud-based eCommerce analytics platform  
- Learn ETL techniques on Big Data using AWS native tools  
- Set up staging layers and data lakes using S3  
- Create and assign IAM roles and policies for secure AWS access  
- Explore a real-world eCommerce dataset with multiple event types  
- Install and configure AWS CLI for environment control  
- Work with Amazon Kinesis for real-time data streaming  
- Implement Apache Flink for real-time data processing and analytics  
- Build Kinesis Data Analytics applications  
- Define partition keys using AWS Glue and Athena  
- Use AWS Lambda to trigger actions in DynamoDB and SNS  
- Understand DynamoDB modeling for real-time user data  
- Integrate Lambda with Kinesis for streaming transformations  
- Perform ETL to Parquet format using Glue DataBrew and Spark  
- Create BI dashboards using Amazon QuickSight

- Basic understanding of cloud computing and data pipelines  
- An active AWS account with billing alerts enabled  
- Familiarity with CLI tools and JSON IAM policy documents  
- AWS Cloud9 or local IDE with AWS CLI configured

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Services**:  
  - AWS S3  
  - AWS Glue & Glue DataBrew  
  - AWS Athena  
  - AWS Lambda  
  - Amazon Kinesis (Data Streams, Firehose, Analytics)

## Expected Outcomes  
- Build a scalable eCommerce data analytics platform using AWS  
- Simulate user behavior: views, carts, purchases, and abandonment  
- Create batch ETL pipelines using S3, Glue, and Athena  
- Implement real-time stream processing using Kinesis and Apache Flink  
- Design and deploy Lambda functions for alerts and notifications  
- Transform and clean data using AWS Glue DataBrew  
- Model user session data in DynamoDB for fast access  
- Visualize KPIs like cart abandonment, top categories, and daily visitors in QuickSight  
- Detect anomalies and attacks (e.g. DDoS or bots) in real-time with Lambda, SNS, and CloudWatch  

---

## Key Features  
- Real-time streaming pipeline using Amazon Kinesis and Apache Flink  
- Batch analytics pipeline using S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight  
- Serverless compute logic with AWS Lambda for dynamic actions  
- Interactive dashboards created in QuickSight for business intelligence  
- SNS alert notifications triggered by specific user events or thresholds  
- Use of partition keys in Glue and Athena to optimize query performance  
- Creation of IAM roles for secure, role-based resource access  
- Cloud-native ETL using Glue DataBrew for visual transformations  
- CloudWatch monitoring for Lambda, Kinesis, and streaming health metrics  

---

## Important Notes  
- Monitor AWS service usage carefully to avoid unexpected charges  
- Cloud9 has been deprecated for new users; use VS Code with AWS CLI for setup  
- Use Glue Crawlers for schema inference and automation  
- Always define resource-level permissions when creating IAM roles  
- Visualize trends such as abandoned carts or peak browsing hours using hourly/daily aggregations

## Dataset Overview  
This dataset contains user behavioral logs from an online marketplace. Each row represents an interaction:  
- **event_time** – timestamp of the action  
- **event_type** – one of: view, cart, remove_from_cart, purchase  
- **product_id** – product identifier  
- **price** – product price  
- **user_id** – unique user identifier  

You’ll use this data to analyze customer journeys, marketing opportunities, and platform performance.

## Next Steps  
- Integrate Redshift or Aurora for further analytics exploration  
- Add anomaly detection with Amazon Lookout for Metrics  
- Extend real-time detection to include session tracking and recommendation triggers  
- Create CI/CD pipeline to automate ETL job deployments  
- Implement role-based dashboard access in QuickSight using row-level security
