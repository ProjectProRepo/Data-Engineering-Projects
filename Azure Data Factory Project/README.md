# Azure Data Factory and Databricks End-to-End Project

In this Azure Project, you will implement an end-to-end data engineering solution to process and analyze trip transaction data using Azure services. The project leverages Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Databricks, ADLS Gen2, and other services to build a resilient, scalable ETL pipeline with modern data lake architecture concepts like Delta Lake and the Medallion architecture.

---

## Project Objectives

- Understand the trip transaction dataset
- Learn the evolution of Delta Lake and its features
- Explore the Medallion architecture and Delta Lake zones
- Build end-to-end pipelines using Azure Data Factory
- Create and monitor dataflows and datasets in ADF
- Perform transformation using PySpark in Databricks
- Schedule ADF pipelines and automate alerts using Logic Apps
- Monitor and manage pipeline sessions in ADF

---

## Prerequisites

- Azure Subscription with access to ADF, Databricks, and ADLS Gen2
- Basic familiarity with Python, SQL, and Spark
- Working knowledge of Azure Portal and GitHub integration (optional)

---

## Tech Stack

**Languages**: Python, SQL, Spark  
**Packages**: PySpark  
**Services**: Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Logic Apps, Azure SQL Database

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Develop a resilient, automated ETL pipeline with data lakehouse architecture
- Enable real-time pipeline monitoring and alerting with Azure Logic Apps
- Extract actionable insights on trip behavior, driver performance, and customer preferences
- Practice working with Delta Lake features like time travel and schema evolution

---

## Key Features

- Use ADF to replicate raw trip data into a **bronze layer** of ADLS Gen2
- Process and transform the data using **Azure Databricks** and PySpark into a **silver layer**
- Implement structured workflows based on the **Medallion architecture**
- Automate pipeline failure notifications with **Logic Apps**
- Use **ADF Studio** to build and manage dataflows and pipeline orchestration
- Explore **Delta Lake** capabilities including versioning and schema evolution
- Monitor Spark jobs and pipeline performance metrics in real-time

---

## Important Notes

- Mounting Azure Blob storage within Databricks enables seamless read/write access for data processing.
- GitHub integration within ADF and Databricks facilitates version control and CI/CD automation.
- Delta Lake plays a crucial role in evolving traditional data lakes into reliable and scalable data lakehouses.
- Logic Apps allow for real-time email triggers in case of pipeline failures, improving resiliency and alert management.

## Dataset Overview

This project uses **trip transaction data**, stored in an Azure SQL Database. The dataset includes transactional records such as:

- Trip ID
- Trip start and end timestamps
- Driver ID and ratings
- Customer ID
- Trip cost and duration
- Payment method
- Route distance and pickup/drop locations

## Next Steps

- Explore advanced Delta Lake operations like time travel and clone
- Extend the medallion architecture to include a **gold layer** for aggregated analytics
- Integrate Power BI with Azure Synapse or Databricks for business reporting
- Enable automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipelines
- Set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure access to datasets and notebooks
