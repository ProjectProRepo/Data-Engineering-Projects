# Hands-On Real-Time PySpark Project for Beginners

## Overview

This beginner-friendly project introduces you to **Apache Spark** and its Python interface **PySpark**, focusing on building a strong foundational understanding of distributed data processing. You'll explore Spark’s architecture, core components, and its practical implementation using **PySpark**, all while working with a real-world dataset—**New York City Taxi Trip Records**.

By the end of this hands-on project, you’ll gain in-depth knowledge of Spark concepts such as **Spark Sessions**, **RDDs**, **DataFrames**, **Spark SQL**, **Transformations**, **Actions**, **Streaming**, and **Optimization Techniques**. You'll also understand how Spark operates under the hood through concepts like **Spark Context**, **Cluster Manager**, **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**, and **Data Shuffling**.

This project sets the stage for an extensive PySpark learning series, progressing from fundamentals to more advanced real-time and ML-based applications.

## Dataset Overview

**Dataset**: NYC TLC Taxi Trip Record Data  
**Source**: NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)  
**Description**:  
This dataset contains detailed information about individual taxi trips in NYC, including:

- Pickup/Drop-off timestamps and coordinates
- Trip duration and distance
- Fare amounts and payment methods
- Taxi ID and vendor details

**Use Cases**:
- Analyze trip patterns across time and geography
- Predict high-demand zones or fare optimization
- Understand urban mobility trends
- Real-time traffic and demand monitoring with streaming

The dataset is substantial in size and ideal for distributed computing using PySpark.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Spark Context vs Spark Session
- Spark Driver and Executors
- Spark Cluster Manager (Local/Standalone/YARN)
- DAG and Lazy Evaluation
- Transformations vs Actions
- RDDs vs DataFrames vs Datasets
- Spark SQL for querying structured data
- Data Shuffling in Spark
- Spark Application Life Cycle
- Real-Time Data Processing using Spark Streaming

---

## Next Steps

- Extend the project to include **Machine Learning** with **MLlib**.
- Integrate **Kafka** for real-time streaming ingestion.
- Deploy on cloud (AWS EMR, Databricks, or Google Cloud Dataproc).
- Use **Airflow** for scheduling and orchestration.
- Incorporate **Delta Lake** for unified batch + streaming architecture.

## Important Notes

- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed (Java, Spark, Python).
- Use `.persist()` or `.cache()` wisely to optimize job performance.
- Monitor DAGs using Spark UI to understand job execution plans.
- Always partition data for optimal parallelism.
