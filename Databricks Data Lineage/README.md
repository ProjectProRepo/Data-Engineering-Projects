# Databricks Data Lineage and Replication Management  
In this Databricks project, you'll implement data lineage and replication management using Azure services, Databricks, Delta Live Tables, and GitHub. You'll learn to manage metadata, validate data replication, and optimize processing using Unity Catalog and Docker deployments.

---

## Project Objectives  
- Understand the overall architecture and project goals  
- Learn data lineage principles and their business value  
- Understand the importance of metadata management  
- Set up and configure Azure resources for the pipeline  
- Configure and deploy an Azure Databricks cluster  
- Perform full and incremental data replication strategies  
- Use Delta Live Tables and SQL Server as data sources  
- Fetch and manage metadata from GitHub in Databricks  
- Mount and interact with Azure Storage in Databricks  
- Create Python test classes to validate replicated data  
- Deploy using Docker and Databricks API integration  
- Understand and use Unity Catalog for governance

## Prerequisites  
- Active Microsoft Azure subscription  
- Basic understanding of Databricks and Spark architecture  
- Familiarity with SQL and Python programming  
- Understanding of metadata concepts and cloud storage  
- Access to SQL Server and GitHub repositories  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Libraries**: PySpark  
- **Services**: Azure Storage Account, Azure Databricks, Azure Logic Apps, SQL Server, Docker, GitHub  
- **Data Sources**: Delta Live Tables, SQL Server, CSV  
- **Tools**: Unity Catalog, GitHub, Docker CLI  

---

## Expected Outcomes  
- Build a robust data replication framework using Databricks  
- Track data lineage across multiple datasets and sources  
- Integrate GitHub metadata for tracking schema changes  
- Implement full and incremental data loads efficiently  
- Validate replication accuracy using Python test cases  
- Enhance traceability and consistency using Unity Catalog  
- Deploy the entire workflow with Docker and APIs  

---

## Key Features  
- Configure storage and compute infrastructure in Azure  
- Mount Azure Storage containers inside Databricks  
- Use GitHub metadata for replication and schema tracking  
- Replicate sample datasets from SQL Server and Delta tables  
- Use Delta Live Tables for structured data ingestion  
- Implement Python-based validation for record counts  
- Use Azure Logic Apps to automate replication triggers  
- Enable data access control via Unity Catalog integration  
- Automate pipeline deployment using Docker and Databricks API  

---

## Important Notes  
- A comprehensive Cookbook is available in the project files to assist with implementation steps.  
- Databricks DBFS mount (`/mnt`) has been deprecated—use the alternative approach provided in the “Alternative to Deprecated Mount” video.  
- Always monitor Azure service usage to avoid unexpected cloud charges and shut down unused resources post-execution.

## Dataset Overview  
This project uses multiple data sources including:  
- **Delta Live Tables**: Sample customer dataset at `dbfs:/databricks-datasets/tpch/delta-001/`  
- **SQL Server**: Employee dataset hosted in a sample on-premise or cloud-hosted SQL database

## Next Steps  
- Incorporate more data sources such as APIs or event streams  
- Implement advanced data quality checks and alerts  
- Enable scheduling via ADF triggers or Logic Apps for automation  
- Use Unity Catalog for auditing and access controls across workspaces  
- Build dashboards to visualize data lineage and replication metrics
