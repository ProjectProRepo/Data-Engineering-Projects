# PySpark ETL Project for Real-Time Data Processing  
In this PySpark project, you'll build a real-time ETL data pipeline using Spark Structured Streaming and Kafka. You'll simulate real-time data ingestion, perform transformations using PySpark, and load the processed data into multiple destinations like MySQL, Hive, Cassandra, and Redshift. This project demonstrates how modern data engineering tools work together to support scalable, real-time analytics.

## Project Objectives  
- Install and configure PySpark in a local environment  
- Understand real-time data streaming fundamentals  
- Learn Spark Structured Streaming concepts and implementation  
- Compare ETL and ELT processes and identify when to use each  
- Understand the basics of Kafka streaming architecture  
- Create an AWS account following cloud best practices  
- Implement ETL pipelines using Kafka and PySpark  
- Integrate PySpark with MySQL, Hive, Cassandra, and Redshift  
- Explore real-world use cases of Kafka-based streaming pipelines  

---

## Prerequisites  
- Python installed with basic programming knowledge  
- Familiarity with Apache Spark and SQL  
- Basic understanding of stream processing and message queues  
- Installed Java and configured environment variables for Spark  
- Access to an AWS account (free tier is sufficient for this project)

## Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Python, SQL  
- **Package**: PySpark  
- **Services**: Apache Kafka, MySQL, Hive, Cassandra, Redshift

## Expected Outcomes  
- Understand the fundamentals of real-time data processing  
- Build and deploy an ETL pipeline using PySpark and Kafka  
- Transform streaming data using PySpark Structured Streaming  
- Integrate Kafka topics with PySpark consumers  
- Load processed data into MySQL, Hive, Cassandra, and Redshift  
- Apply windowed operations and streaming aggregations  
- Ensure data fault tolerance using checkpointing and WAL  

---

## Key Features  
- Set up PySpark on a local system for development  
- Stream real-time data using Apache Kafka topics  
- Consume Kafka data streams in PySpark and perform transformations  
- Use Spark Structured Streaming for micro-batch processing  
- Apply concepts like event-time windowing and incremental updates  
- Load transformed data into multiple databases for downstream analysis  
- Understand integration points across Kafka, PySpark, and storage systems  
- Compare ETL vs ELT and implement appropriate patterns based on use case  
- Leverage Kafka ecosystem components: brokers, topics, partitions, producers, and consumers  

---

## Important Notes  
- Always enable checkpointing in Spark streaming to ensure fault tolerance  
- Use small micro-batch intervals during local testing to simulate real-time flow  
- Organize Kafka topics based on use cases and message schemas  
- Apply schema validation and transformation best practices in PySpark  
- Use AWS free tier resources wisely to avoid incurring unexpected costs

## Dataset Overview  
This project uses simulated real-time data streamed via Apache Kafka. The data mimics real-world use cases such as customer activity, transactions, or sensor readings. These streaming datasets are ingested into Spark for transformation and then loaded into various storage systems.

## Next Steps  
- Extend the project to include real IoT or web-based streaming sources  
- Monitor streaming jobs using Spark UI and Kafka monitoring tools  
- Deploy your pipeline on a cloud cluster using AWS EMR or Databricks  
- Explore advanced integrations with tools like Apache Flink or Apache NiFi  
- Secure your Kafka and Spark pipeline using authentication and role-based access
