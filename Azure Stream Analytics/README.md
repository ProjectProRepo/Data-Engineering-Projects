# Azure Stream Analytics for Real-Time Cab Service Monitoring  

## Overview  

The ability to analyze data as soon as it enters a system is crucial for businesses to make **real-time decisions**. Traditional **batch analytics** methods take hours or even days to process, resulting in delayed insights. **Real-time analytics**, on the other hand, allows companies to **react instantly** to new data, optimizing processes and preventing potential issues before they arise.  

This project focuses on **building a real-time cab service monitoring system** using **Azure Stream Analytics**. With the increasing popularity of cab services like **Uber and Ola**, monitoring live booking and ride data is essential. The **architecture of this project replicates how these companies track real-time booking activity via a Power BI dashboard**.  

## Project Objectives  
- Learn the **fundamentals of real-time analytics** and its advantages over batch processing.  
- Explore **Azure Stream Analytics** and how it processes live data streams.  
- Set up **Azure Event Hubs** as an ingestion point for ride booking and drop data.  
- Store real-time streaming data in **Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL)** for efficient retrieval.  
- Integrate **Power BI dashboards** to visualize cab booking trends, commissions, and ride statistics.  
- Implement **Azure Monitor** to detect anomalies and trigger alerts.  
- Deploy a **data pipeline** that follows the **Ingest, Analyze, and Deliver** model.  

## Prerequisites  
Before starting this project, ensure you have:  

- A **basic understanding of SQL, C#, and real-time data processing**.  
- Familiarity with **Azure Cloud Services**, including **Virtual Machines, Event Hubs, and Cosmos DB**.  
- Experience with **Power BI for data visualization**.  
- An **active Azure account** (ensure you review pricing details for service usage).  

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: SQL, C#  
- **Cloud Services**: Azure Virtual Machine (VM), Azure Event Hubs, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Power BI  
- **Analytics Tool**: Azure Monitor  

## Expected Outcomes  
By completing this project, you will:  

- Gain hands-on experience in **building a real-time analytics pipeline**.  
- Understand how **Azure Stream Analytics processes live streaming data**.  
- Set up an **Event Hub to handle millions of data points per second**.  
- Use **Power BI dashboards** to monitor key cab service metrics.  
- Store and manage **real-time booking data in Azure Cosmos DB**.  
- Implement **real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms** using **Azure Monitor**.  


## Key Features of the Real-Time Cab Monitoring System  
- **Live Data Streaming**: Processes **real-time booking and ride completion events**.  
- **Data Enrichment**: Combines **cab owner and customer details** for deeper insights.  
- **NoSQL Database Storage**: Uses **Cosmos DB** for scalable and flexible data management.  
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboards**: Provides **real-time insights** into cab bookings and trends.  
- **Automated Monitoring & Alerts**: Uses **Azure Monitor** to detect anomalies and send alerts.  

## Important Notes  
- **Azure Services Costs**: Using **Azure Stream Analytics, Event Hubs, and Cosmos DB** may incur **cloud service charges**. Review Azure pricing before deployment.  
- **NoSQL for Cosmos DB**: Choose **Core SQL API (NoSQL)** for better performance in managing unstructured data.  
- **Power BI Licensing**: Ensure your **Power BI account supports real-time dashboards** for full functionality.
